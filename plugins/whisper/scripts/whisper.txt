The Public Access functionality in Resource Space allows anyone with the URL of your system
to access certain content. A specific user group is configured so that anyone visiting the site
without a login will inherit the permissions of that user group. That means you have complete
control over the resources they can see, their Dash, Featured Collections and Search functionality.
You'll also be able to customise the system logo and welcome text.
Of course, you can specify whether content should be downloadable or not too.
This allows you to create a bespoke, public-facing window to your digital assets.
